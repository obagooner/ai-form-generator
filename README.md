## 🧠 How It Works

This project uses a simulated AI engine based on intelligent keyword parsing and rule-based generation. User descriptions are analyzed for common form-related terms (e.g., email, password, message), which are then mapped to appropriate HTML input types and accessibility attributes.

The architecture mirrors real AI workflows while remaining free, fast, and ideal for public demos and portfolio use.

## 💡 Problem & Solution

**Problem:**  
Creating accessible HTML forms is repetitive and error-prone, especially during rapid prototyping or early-stage product development.

**Solution:**  
This tool allows users to describe a form in plain English and instantly receive clean, accessible HTML with a live preview — reducing setup time while enforcing best practices by default.
